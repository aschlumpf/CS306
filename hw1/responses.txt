Self Driving Cars

Drivers

With self driving cars, drivers could see less accidents. Additionally, there will be less stress involved with driving as the vehicle itself will do all of the work. A final, more far off, impact is that the technology could enable those with disabilities to have their own vehicles.

Pedestrians

If autonomous vehicles become mainstream, pedestrians may have a more consistent experience when crossing busy roads. Additionally, those who do not own cars may benefit from cheaper, automated ride sharing services. With the technology currently available, pedestrians face the risk of getting hit by a poorly trained driving algorithm's mistake.

Car manufacturers

Car manufacturers stand to make great profit if they are the first to market with the best autonomous driving technology. The manufacturers also stand to face legal trouble when the technology does not work as anticipated.If the technology is outlawed, then all investment in research and development for self-driving cars will go to waste.

An ethical concern that self-driving cars present is the unemployment of the large number of individuals who drive for a living. In the United States, full-time driving jobs present lucrative opportunities that are accessible to much of the public. With the prospect of self-driving cars, these jobs stand to become obsolete. Purchasing a self-driving vehicle from a vendor with guaranteed maintenance is ultimately cheaper than paying a driver and incurring the risk that comes along with the driver's employment.  It is no secret that commercial trucking, taxi, ride-sharing, and busing, services will look to employ self-driving cars when the technology reaches a stable point. Full-time drivers will be left with no jobs to fall back on, and overall these drivers stand to lose the most with the development of autonomous vehicles.  If the government were to outlaw self-driving cars, then technological progress would be put to a stand-still, and the United States may be at a disadvantage in the global economy. Investing in training drivers to learn a new job presents a different challenge, as it is not clear when these jobs truly will disappear.  Self-driving cars leave full-time drivers in a vulnerable position that puts their livelihood at risk, and the technology can be a detriment to the economy if its implementation is not handled with care.

IT professionals hold the responsibility to ensure that the systems they create are held to a high ethical standard. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) defines ethical guidelines for software to adhere to. Complex systems such as self-driving cars present unique ethical challenges in multiple facets, and those building these systems must be aware of their impact on society. Code 2.5 references how systems must consider the possible risk involved with the creation of software. Clearly, self-driving cars create a safety risk for both drivers and pedestrians, as the nature of the technology relies on failure in order to product robust models. The way in which the models are trained must be carefully considered so that no harm is done in the process. Code 3.7 addresses the impact software may have on society as a whole, and self-driving cars will impact society in countless ways. Perhaps the most clear impact self-driving cars will have is on the full-time drivers. IT professionals involved with self-driving cars should bear in mind that their software may make multiple careers obsolete. While it would be unreasonable to expect these engineers to forfeit their own projects in favor of protecting full-time drivers, the engineers should be open and honest about their goals.
